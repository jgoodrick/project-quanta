# UX Design

## Overall
The goal of Project Q is to make the collection and curating of the words one encounters as a language-learner a more personal and engaging process than it generally is. The app is inspired by the age-old practice of keeping a notebook nearby at all times to record any new words or phrases you hear, particularly when immersed in a foreign culture or language, and reviewing those collected entries regularly.  

## Multiplatform and Multi-device support
One of the goals of this project is to make an app that can be operated from all of the different Apple platforms and that will be synchronized across all of a person's different iCloud devices.

### Initial Features
The following features are expected to be built soon in order to facilitate the core language-learning functionality originally envisioned for this app:

* Recording Words
	Recording and documenting the vocabulary you encounter for later review when learning a language is the primary concern of this app. The goal is to be able to record a word quickly and easily, no matter which platform you are on. 
* Relationships between words
	This includes translations, etymological context, grammar, synonyms, antonyms, etc.
* Example usages of recorded words or phrases
* Definitions and/or contextual notes 
	These are intended to give more background on when certain words and phrases are appropriate or expected to be used.
* Mnemonic or visual aids
	These are intended to facilitate more engaging and effective review sessions and assist in memorization and recall
* Pronunciation and intonation guides

There is ample opportunity for the functionality of this app to continue to grow and expand. But the core aim of the app is to create an enjoyable UX that facilitates the above features.

#### Open Source
The development and maintenance of this app is intended to be collaborative and provide a space for those interested in language learning and in Apple development to come together to create something for everyone in the community to benefit from. There will always be a free version of the app that provides all local functionality. Eventually, if the app expands to require external resources and the cost of maintenance requires it, there may be some server-based features that will require a minimal subscription. However, the app should always work locally for free, for everyone. In addition, new features created by the community that don't have inherent costs associated with them will always be free.

#### Fun
The hope is that we can create an app that is fun to use and reduces some of the friction around learning a new language. If you have an idea for how to make it more fun and engaging, join us and help us make it a reality!
