### Personal language repository
### Language mapping

## The problem
When you rely on an app like Duolingo or Mondly to teach you a language, you are not in control of new content or even when to review which words. You don’t have any control over the content or the structure of the things you are learning. But our brains learn new things by making connections to things we already understand. Memorization is much harder without context. 

## The solution
Therefore, this app has one purpose: to allow you to personally create a digital repository that maps the connections between words and the contexts that they are used in. This repository can mimic the way your brain makes connections and can serve as a second brain for any and all words (and word usages) you want to learn. 

## The goal
We need to create a user experience that is as seamless and invisible as possible. There should be as little friction between the moment a user encounters a new word, and the moment they have it recorded in their repo. The collection of words should be fun and easy, so that the user feels like they are capturing Pokémon or playing a scavenger hunt by using this app. 

We need a combination of entry, review, correlation, and augmentation tools that allow the user to flesh out their language repo both broadly and deeply, depending on their preference or current objectives.

## What it’s not
The obvious extension of this idea is to integrate it with external resources (servers, online dictionaries, AI, etc), prompts (games, challenges, alerts, etc), and social aspects (chatbots, forums, partners, etc). However, these aspects are only considered as a future direction and not part of the current scope (unless you want to contribute and make those things happen!). 

This is also, importantly, not a language learning app of the Duolingo variety, with a predefined curriculum. In fact, this is probably the most unique aspect of the app, among the other apps in its category. You create the content of this app yourself. It is exactly that process of creation and curation that enables it to offer something other apps don’t.
Lastly, although it shares some resemblance to a flash card app, it has an extremely limited scope for the domain of the content, and an integral connection to the language entries are tied to, which allows for more targeted and powerful features that wouldn’t translate well to a system as generalized as a set of flash cards, which could be about anything.
